## AI-Powered Web Development for Everyone

The Vercel Zero Project by Humanitarians AI is an initiative to democratize web development through AI technology. We provide tutorials, templates, and resources to help students, non-profits, and small organizations create professional branded websites with minimal technical experience.

## About V0

V0 is Vercel's revolutionary AI assistant for web development that transforms text prompts into functional code. Our project builds on this technology to make it accessible to users focusing on personal branding and organizational outreach.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a free Vercel account** at [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. **Follow our tutorials** in the `/tutorials` directory
3. **Explore our templates** in the `/templates` directory
4. **Join our community** for support and inspiration

## The Maya Method: Building with V0

Our approach follows the iterative "Maya Method" for effective results:

```
Just type
Then check
Then iterate and change
Repeat till your website feels amazing
```
